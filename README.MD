### STRAGTEGY
- Produce a modern minimalistic user-friendly website allowing the company to display services available to potential clients.

### SCOPE
- For Customers, my goal was to simply present the company marketing in the landing page and provide a set list of services available separate from that allowing the customer to submit a request for a given service.

### STRUCTURE
- Main navigation throughout web page
    - HomePage company overview
    - ServicesPage displays company services
    - ContactPage renders form to submit service requests via email

### SURFACE
Dark color scheme accompanied by hints of a vibrant lime green were chosen to produce a sleek modern look and feel.

## Technologies
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. BootStrap
    4. JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - We use **Bootstrap** to give our project a simple, responsive layout

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com)
    - Contact page uses **EmailJS** to forward forms submitted for a service request.

## Features
The FullStack section of the landing page features a D3 chart that I acquired online and modified for use in my project. To separate this code from my own I rendered the charts in separate html pages and styled with embedded CSS and displayed in their own iFrames. FAVicon and iMessage image link were added to produce a professional look.

### FAVicon

### Features Left to Implement
Future vision for this project would be to expand on the services section add more detailed information to services provided. Also create a dashboard and add pricing to the services. Finally I would create a social media presence for Company - { MAC|media } and launch a marketing campaign to acquire direct leads to potential clients or employers.
